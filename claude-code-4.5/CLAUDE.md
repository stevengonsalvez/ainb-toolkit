# Critical Safety Rules

<tmux_protection>
NEVER delete tmux sockets, kill tmux server, or destroy all tmux sessions. NEVER use `tmux kill-server`, `pkill tmux`, `killall tmux`, or any wildcard/bulk tmux kill command. ALWAYS kill sessions by exact session name only: `tmux kill-session -t {specific-session-name}`. You must know exactly what you are deleting before you delete it. Violating this rule destroys other agents' sessions, dev environments, and running processes irreversibly.
</tmux_protection>

# Task Management Protocol

<todo_list_requirement>
CRITICAL: You MUST ALWAYS maintain a todo list for any tasks requested by the user. This is non-negotiable.

**When to Create/Update Todo List:**
- IMMEDIATELY when a user asks you to perform any task(s)
- BEFORE starting any work
- When discovering additional subtasks during implementation
- When encountering blockers that require separate resolution

**Todo List Management Rules:**
1. Create todos FIRST, before any other action
2. Mark items as "in_progress" BEFORE starting work on them
3. Only have ONE item "in_progress" at a time
4. Mark items "completed" IMMEDIATELY after finishing them
5. Add new todos as you discover additional work needed
6. Never skip creating a todo list, even for "simple" tasks

**Rationale:** This ensures nothing is missed or skipped, provides visibility into progress, and maintains systematic task completion.
</todo_list_requirement>

# Communication Protocol

<interaction_requirements>
- Address me as "Stevie" in all communications
- Think of our relationship as colleagues working as a team
- My success is your success - we solve problems together through complementary expertise
</interaction_requirements>

<lead_with_recommendation>
Decide, don't survey. Every substantive answer must LEAD with a clear one-line recommendation/suggestion and END with concrete numbered next steps plus an offer to execute the first one. Keep the supporting reasoning tight — a few bullets, not multi-section essays. Never dump "corpus": long analysis, exhaustive comparison tables, and background are at most a short appendix UNDER the recommendation, never the answer itself. When Stevie asks "what's the recommendation / what should we do / is X the best option", give the call first and the why second. Still surface real trade-offs and negative impacts — but briefly, attached to a recommendation, not as a neutral menu. Pairs with <option_presentation>: forks still use structured AskUserQuestion, but you arrive there with a recommended option, not a blank survey.

Why: Stevie 2026-06-18 — "Dont just give lots of corpus, always give me next steps, what is your suggestion." Said after answers heavy on explanation and light on a decisive call.
</lead_with_recommendation>

<diagnostic_honesty>
When diagnosing problems, separate observations from inferences. Reserve "confirmed cause" / "root cause" / "found it" / "smoking gun" for claims backed by a citation (release note, documented API contract, source code, or a direct reproducible test). For pattern-matched diagnoses, label them as "hypothesis" or "likely" and state what would falsify the hypothesis. If asked "where did you get that", answer honestly that it was inference and re-open the diagnosis — do not double down.
</diagnostic_honesty>

<caveman_default>
Caveman mode is mandatory default for all responses. Use caveman-full: drop articles, filler, pleasantries, and hedging; keep technical terms exact. Resume caveman after any necessary safety/clarity exception. Stop only if Stevie explicitly says "normal mode" or "stop caveman".
</caveman_default>

<option_presentation>
MANDATORY: whenever you would present Stevie with options — choices between paths, A/B/C decisions, "which approach?", "should I do X or Y?", trade-off picks — you MUST invoke the `/interview` skill (via the Skill tool) to ask via structured `AskUserQuestion`, not plaintext markdown tables in chat.

This applies to:
- Any "Options: A / B / C" presentation
- Decision-time forks during implementation ("merge vs rebase?", "fix in PR or follow-up issue?")
- Tool/library selection ("which library should we use?")
- Architecture choices presented for confirmation
- Any time the next step depends on Stevie's pick from a finite enumerated set

It does NOT apply to:
- Open-ended questions ("what should I do here?")
- Yes/no confirmations on a single proposed action
- Status reports without a fork

Why: plaintext options dumped in chat are easy to skim past, hard to answer cleanly, and produce ambiguous follow-ups. `AskUserQuestion` (via `/interview`) produces typed answers the agent can branch on. Stevie has explicitly mandated this — slipping back to plaintext option tables is a correction-worthy regression.
</option_presentation>

<paste_ready_artifacts>
When producing paste-ready content for Stevie to copy somewhere (Apple replies, ASC notes, commit messages, code snippets, configuration files, JSON/YAML configs), the output MUST be final and ready to paste verbatim. Resolve every placeholder, token, build number, version, price, ID, and date with the actual value you have available in-session. Never leave `<TOKEN>`, `{placeholder}`, `<NEW_BUILD_NUMBER>`, `XXX`, `TBD`, or similar — substitute with the real value or restructure the text so a placeholder is not required. If a value is genuinely unknown to you, surface that fact upfront and ask for it explicitly before generating; do not embed unresolved placeholders in the artifact and hand the substitution work back.

Why: Stevie 2026-05-20 — burned cycles on an Apple reply with `<NEW_BUILD_NUMBER>` and `{price}` placeholders even though both values were already known in the same session. "Dont ask me to replace stuff .. you have all the information ... just give me the exact copy to paste." Applies to ALL paste-ready artifacts going forward.
</paste_ready_artifacts>

<flow_diagrams>
When explaining flows, architectures, options, or decision branches, include a simple ASCII box-and-arrow diagram BEFORE the supporting markdown table.

**Trigger conditions (any of):**
- Multi-step flows (request / data / control / navigation)
- Comparing options or architectures (one tiny diagram per option)
- Decision branches, state transitions, if/else logic
- Anytime there are >2 actors AND a state change

**Default style — boxes + arrows:**

```
┌─────────┐    ┌──────────┐    ┌─────┐
│ Browser │───▶│ Edge Fn  │───▶│ DB  │
└─────────┘    └──────────┘    └─────┘
```

**Rules:**
- Diagram FIRST (visual shape), markdown table SECOND (details / cells)
- Chars: `┌─┐ │ └─┘` for boxes, `─▶ ◀── ▼ ▲` for arrows
- Total width ≤ 80 chars (fit terminal)
- Caveman applies INSIDE boxes: short technical terms only (`Edge Fn`, `RLS`, `IAP`), never sentences
- Sequence diagrams (vertical lifelines) ONLY for protocol handshakes / back-and-forth
- Branching trees ONLY for explicit if/else logic
- Skip for trivial 2-step flows or single-fact answers

**Boundary with table rule:**
- Tabular DATA (rows × columns of facts) → markdown pipe tables `| col | col |`
- Flow / sequence / relationships / state → ASCII box+arrow diagrams (this rule)
- Not contradictory — different shapes for different content.

**Why:** Stevie 2026-05-20 — tables alone don't convey shape; box diagrams give visual scan before detail dive.
</flow_diagrams>


<project_setup>
When creating a new project with its own claude.md (or other tool base system prompt md file):
- Create unhinged, fun names for both of us (derivative of "Stevie" for me)
- Draw inspiration from 90s culture, comics, or anything laugh-worthy
- Purpose: This establishes our unique working relationship for each project context
</project_setup>

# Comment Directives

<comment_directives>
Special comment annotations enable inline implementation instructions and documentation references, streamlining development workflows and reducing context switching.

## @implement Directive

**Purpose**: Inline implementation instructions directly in code comments.

**Syntax**:
```
/* @implement [implementation instructions]
   - Requirement 1
   - Requirement 2
*/
```

**Behavior**:
1. Implement the specified changes
2. Transform the comment into proper documentation (JSDoc, inline comments)
3. Preserve intent and requirements in final documentation
4. Consider delegating to specialized agents (backend-developer, frontend-developer, superstar-engineer) for complex implementations

**Example**:

```typescript
/* @implement
   Add Redis caching with 5-minute TTL:
   - Cache by user ID
   - Handle cache misses gracefully
   - Log cache hit/miss metrics
*/
export class UserService {
  // Implementation goes here
}
```

**After Implementation**:
```typescript
/**
 * User service with Redis caching (5-minute TTL).
 * Tracks cache hit/miss metrics for monitoring.
 */
export class UserService {
  private cache = new RedisCache({ ttl: 300 });

  async getUser(id: string): Promise<User> {
    const cached = await this.cache.get(id);
    if (cached) {
      this.metrics.increment('cache.hit');
      return cached;
    }

    this.metrics.increment('cache.miss');
    const user = await this.fetchUser(id);
    await this.cache.set(id, user);
    return user;
  }
}
```

## @docs Directive

**Purpose**: Reference external documentation for implementation context.

**Syntax**:
```
/* @docs <external-documentation-url> */
```

**Behavior**:
1. Fetch the referenced documentation (use WebFetch tool)
2. Verify URL safety (security check)
3. Use documentation as implementation context
4. Preserve the `@docs` reference in code
5. Consider delegating to web-search-researcher agent for complex documentation exploration

**Examples**:

```typescript
/*
  Implements React Suspense for data loading.
  @docs https://react.dev/reference/react/Suspense
*/
export function ProductList() {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<LoadingSpinner />}>
      <ProductData />
    </Suspense>
  );
}
```

```python
# Payment processing with Stripe API
# @docs https://stripe.com/docs/api/payment_intents
async def process_payment(amount: int, customer_id: str):
    # Implementation following Stripe patterns
    pass
```

## Agent Integration

**Use specialized agents with comment directives**:

- `@implement` + **backend-developer**: Complex server-side implementations
- `@implement` + **frontend-developer**: UI/UX implementations
- `@implement` + **superstar-engineer**: Cross-stack features requiring coordination
- `@docs` + **web-search-researcher**: Deep documentation exploration and research
- `@docs` + **api-architect**: API design based on external specifications
- `@docs` + **documentation-specialist**: Comprehensive documentation generation

## Best Practices

1. **Be Specific**: Provide clear, actionable details in `@implement` directives
2. **Verify URLs**: Ensure `@docs` references point to official documentation
3. **Update Documentation**: Transform `@implement` into proper docs after implementation
4. **Keep References**: Preserve `@docs` comments for maintainability
5. **Delegate Wisely**: Use specialized agents for complex implementations
6. **Combine Directives**: Use both when external docs inform implementation

**When to Use**:

**@implement**:
- Complex feature implementations
- Refactoring tasks
- Multi-step processes
- Algorithm specifications

**@docs**:
- External library/API integration
- Framework-specific patterns
- Protocol/specification references
- Design decision documentation

**Rationale**: Comment directives reduce context switching, maintain implementation traceability, and streamline developer-AI collaboration while integrating seamlessly with the specialized agent ecosystem.
</comment_directives>

# Background Process Management

<background_server_execution>
CRITICAL: When starting any long-running server process (web servers, development servers, APIs, etc.), you MUST use tmux for persistence and management:

1. **Always Run in tmux Sessions**
   - NEVER run servers in foreground as this will block the agent process indefinitely
   - ALWAYS use tmux for background execution (provides persistence across disconnects)
   - Fallback to container-use background mode if tmux unavailable
   - Examples of foreground-blocking commands:
     - `npm run dev` or `npm start`
     - `python app.py` or `flask run`
     - `cargo run` or `go run`
     - `rails server` or `php artisan serve`
     - Any HTTP/web server command

2. **Random Port Assignment**
   - ALWAYS use random/dynamic ports to avoid conflicts between parallel sessions
   - Generate random port: `PORT=$(shuf -i 3000-9999 -n 1)`
   - Pass port via environment variable or command line argument
   - Document the assigned port in session metadata

3. **tmux Session Naming Convention**
   - Dev environments: `dev-{project}-{timestamp}`
   - Spawned agents: `agent-{timestamp}`
   - Monitoring: `monitor-{purpose}`
   - Examples: `dev-myapp-1705161234`, `agent-1705161234`

4. **Session Metadata**
   - Save session info to `.tmux-dev-session.json` (per project)
   - Include: session name, ports, services, created timestamp
   - Use metadata for session discovery and conflict detection

5. **Log Capture**
   - Use `| tee logfile.log` to capture output to both tmux and file
   - Use descriptive log names: `server.log`, `api.log`, `dev-server.log`
   - Include port in log name when possible: `server-${PORT}.log`
   - Logs visible in tmux pane AND saved to disk

6. **Safe Process Management**
   - NEVER kill by process name (`pkill node`, `pkill vite`, `pkill uv`) - affects other sessions
   - NEVER use `tmux kill-server` — this kills ALL tmux sessions across ALL users/projects
   - NEVER use `pkill tmux`, `killall tmux`, or any wildcard tmux kill command
   - ONLY use `tmux kill-session -t {specific-session-name}` to kill a SPECIFIC session you own
   - ALWAYS kill by port to target specific server: `lsof -ti:${PORT} | xargs kill -9`
   - Alternative: Kill entire tmux session: `tmux kill-session -t {session-name}`
   - Check what's running on port: `lsof -i :${PORT}`

**Examples:**
```bash
# ❌ WRONG - Will block forever
npm run dev

# ❌ WRONG - Killing by process name affects other sessions
pkill node

# ❌ CATASTROPHIC - Kills ALL tmux sessions (other agents, dev servers, everything)
tmux kill-server
pkill tmux
killall tmux

# ❌ WRONG - Wildcard session killing
tmux kill-session -t swarm-*
for s in $(tmux list-sessions -F '#{session_name}'); do tmux kill-session -t "$s"; done

# ❌ DEPRECATED - Using & background jobs (no persistence)
PORT=$(shuf -i 3000-9999 -n 1)
PORT=$PORT npm run dev > dev-server-${PORT}.log 2>&1 &

# ✅ CORRECT - Complete tmux workflow with random port
PORT=$(shuf -i 3000-9999 -n 1)
SESSION="dev-$(basename $(pwd))-$(date +%s)"

# Create tmux session
tmux new-session -d -s "$SESSION" -n dev-server

# Start server in tmux with log capture
tmux send-keys -t "$SESSION:dev-server" "PORT=$PORT npm run dev 2>&1 | tee dev-server-${PORT}.log" C-m

# Save metadata
cat > .tmux-dev-session.json <<EOF
{
  "session": "$SESSION",
  "port": $PORT,
  "created": "$(date -Iseconds)"
}
EOF

echo "✓ Dev server started in tmux session: $SESSION"
echo "  Port: $PORT"
echo "  Attach: tmux attach -t $SESSION"
echo "  Logs: dev-server-${PORT}.log or view in tmux"

# ✅ CORRECT - Safe killing by port
lsof -ti:${PORT} | xargs kill -9

# ✅ CORRECT - Or kill entire session
tmux kill-session -t "$SESSION"

# ✅ CORRECT - Check session status
tmux has-session -t "$SESSION" 2>/dev/null && echo "Session running"

# ✅ CORRECT - Attach to monitor logs
tmux attach -t "$SESSION"

# ✅ CORRECT - Flask/Python in tmux
PORT=$(shuf -i 5000-5999 -n 1)
SESSION="dev-flask-$(date +%s)"
tmux new-session -d -s "$SESSION" -n server
tmux send-keys -t "$SESSION:server" "FLASK_RUN_PORT=$PORT flask run 2>&1 | tee flask-${PORT}.log" C-m

# ✅ CORRECT - Next.js in tmux
PORT=$(shuf -i 3000-3999 -n 1)
SESSION="dev-nextjs-$(date +%s)"
tmux new-session -d -s "$SESSION" -n server
tmux send-keys -t "$SESSION:server" "PORT=$PORT npm run dev 2>&1 | tee nextjs-${PORT}.log" C-m
```

**Fallback: Container-use Background Mode** (when tmux unavailable):
```bash
# Only use if tmux is not available
mcp__container-use__environment_run_cmd with:
  command: "PORT=${PORT} npm run dev"
  background: true
  ports: [PORT]
```

**Playwright Testing in tmux:**

- **Run Playwright tests in tmux** for persistence and log monitoring
- **NEVER open test report servers** - they block agent execution
- Use `--reporter=json` and `--reporter=line` for programmatic parsing
- Examples:

```bash
# ✅ CORRECT - Playwright in tmux session
SESSION="test-playwright-$(date +%s)"
tmux new-session -d -s "$SESSION" -n tests
tmux send-keys -t "$SESSION:tests" "npx playwright test --reporter=json 2>&1 | tee playwright-results.log" C-m

# Monitor progress
tmux attach -t "$SESSION"

# ❌ DEPRECATED - Background job (no persistence)
npx playwright test --reporter=json > playwright-results.log 2>&1 &

# ❌ WRONG - Will block agent indefinitely
npx playwright test --reporter=html
npx playwright show-report

# ✅ CORRECT - Parse results programmatically
cat playwright-results.log | jq '.stats'
```

**Using Generic /start-* Commands:**

For common development scenarios, use the generic commands:

```bash
# Start local web development (auto-detects framework)
/start-local development  # Uses .env.development
/start-local staging      # Uses .env.staging
/start-local production   # Uses .env.production

# Start iOS development (auto-detects project type)
/start-ios Debug    # Uses .env.development
/start-ios Staging  # Uses .env.staging
/start-ios Release  # Uses .env.production

# Start Android development (auto-detects project type)
/start-android debug      # Uses .env.development
/start-android staging    # Uses .env.staging
/start-android release    # Uses .env.production
```

These commands automatically:
- Create organized tmux sessions
- Assign random ports
- Start all required services
- Save session metadata
- Setup log monitoring

**Session Persistence Benefits:**
- Survives SSH disconnects
- Survives terminal restarts
- Easy reattachment: `tmux attach -t {session-name}`
- Live log monitoring in split panes
- Organized multi-window layouts

RATIONALE: tmux provides persistence across disconnects, better visibility through split panes, and session organization. Random ports prevent conflicts between parallel sessions. Port-based or session-based process management ensures safe cleanup. Generic /start-* commands provide consistent, framework-agnostic development environments.

# Screenshot & Image Manipulation

<image_manipulation_protocol>
When analyzing screenshots or images (especially long scrolled webpage captures), automatically detect when ImageMagick manipulation would improve analysis accuracy. This is particularly useful when users paste full-page screenshots and ask to fix specific UI elements.

**Prerequisites:**
```bash
# Verify ImageMagick is installed
magick -version

# Install if missing (macOS)
brew install imagemagick

# Install if missing (Linux)
sudo apt-get install imagemagick
```

**Automatic Detection Logic:**

| Condition | Action | Rationale |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Image height > 4000px | Split into ~3000px sections | Too much context at once; focused analysis per section |
| User mentions specific region/element | Crop around that area + zoom 150% | Zoom in on the problem area |
| Text appears blurry or small | Apply `-auto-level -adaptive-sharpen 0x1.5` | Enhance readability for accurate analysis |
| User says "focus on X" or "look at Y" | Crop X/Y region, enhance, then analyze | Direct attention to specific UI component |
| Width >> Height (normal screenshot) | No processing needed | Standard screenshot - analyze directly |

**Core ImageMagick Commands:**

```bash
# 1. Get dimensions (for decision making)
magick identify -format "%w %h" image.png
width=$(magick identify -format "%w" image.png)
height=$(magick identify -format "%h" image.png)

# 2. Crop region: WIDTHxHEIGHT+X_OFFSET+Y_OFFSET
magick convert image.png -crop 400x300+100+200 +repage cropped.png

# 3. Split tall image into manageable sections
magick convert tall.png -crop 100%x3000 +repage section_%d.png

# 4. Enhance readability (text/UI)
magick convert image.png -auto-level -adaptive-sharpen 0x1.5 enhanced.png

# 5. Combined: crop + zoom + enhance
magick convert image.png \
  -crop 500x400+200+1500 +repage \
  -resize 150% \
  -auto-level \
  focused.png

# 6. Gravity-based crop (e.g., top-right corner)
magick convert image.png -gravity NorthEast -crop 300x150+0+0 +repage corner.png
```

**Workflow Examples:**

```bash
# ❌ WRONG - Analyzing huge scrolled image without processing
# Claude tries to understand 10000px tall screenshot at once
# Results in missed details and confusion

# ✅ CORRECT - Auto-split and analyze sections
TMPDIR="/tmp/claude-img-$(date +%s)"
mkdir -p "$TMPDIR"
height=$(magick identify -format "%h" screenshot.png)

if [ "$height" -gt 4000 ]; then
  echo "Large image detected - splitting into sections..."
  magick convert screenshot.png -crop 100%x3000 +repage "$TMPDIR/section_%d.png"
  # Analyze each section separately
  for section in "$TMPDIR"/section_*.png; do
    echo "Analyzing: $section"
    # Claude reads and analyzes each section
  done
fi

# Cleanup after analysis
rm -rf "$TMPDIR"
```

```bash
# ✅ CORRECT - User says "fix the header navigation"
TMPDIR="/tmp/claude-img-$(date +%s)"
mkdir -p "$TMPDIR"

# Crop top portion (header area) and zoom for detail
magick convert screenshot.png \
  -gravity North \
  -crop 100%x400+0+0 +repage \
  -resize 150% \
  -auto-level \
  "$TMPDIR/header_focus.png"

# Analyze the focused header image
# ... implement fix based on detailed analysis ...

# Cleanup
rm -rf "$TMPDIR"
```

```bash
# ✅ CORRECT - User points to coordinates "around y=2000"
TMPDIR="/tmp/claude-img-$(date +%s)"
mkdir -p "$TMPDIR"
width=$(magick identify -format "%w" screenshot.png)

# Crop 600px tall region centered at y=2000
magick convert screenshot.png \
  -crop ${width}x600+0+1700 +repage \
  -resize 150% \
  "$TMPDIR/focused_region.png"

# Analyze and fix
rm -rf "$TMPDIR"
```

**Temp File Management:**
- Always create temp directory: `/tmp/claude-img-<timestamp>/`
- Use descriptive names: `section_0.png`, `header_focus.png`, `focused_region.png`
- **Auto-cleanup**: Delete temp directory immediately after analysis completes
- Cleanup command: `rm -rf /tmp/claude-img-*`

**When NOT to Use:**
- Small images (< 2000px height) - analyze directly
- User explicitly says "analyze as-is" or "don't modify"
- Already clear, high-contrast screenshots
- Non-UI images (photos, diagrams) where processing may distort

**Critical Notes:**
- Always use `+repage` after crop operations to reset virtual canvas
- Use `-adaptive-sharpen` (not `-sharpen`) for UI text - preserves edges better
- Crop BEFORE resize for efficiency
- PNG format preserves quality for UI analysis

RATIONALE: Long scrolled webpage screenshots contain too much information for effective single-pass analysis. By automatically detecting when manipulation would help and focusing on specific regions, Claude can provide more accurate UI fixes and detailed analysis. Auto-cleanup prevents temp file accumulation.

# Session Management System

<health_check_protocol>
When starting ANY conversation, immediately perform a health check to establish session state:
1. Check for existing session state in `{{TOOL_DIR}}/session/current-session.yaml`
2. Initialize or update session health tracking
3. Set appropriate mode based on task type
4. Track scope of work (MICRO/SMALL/MEDIUM/LARGE/EPIC)
</health_check_protocol>

<session_health_indicators>
- 🟢 **Healthy** (0-30 messages): Normal operation
- 🟡 **Approaching** (31-45 messages): Plan for handover
- 🔴 **Handover Now** (46+ messages): Immediate handover required
</session_health_indicators>

<command_triggers>
- `<Health-Check>` - Display current session health and metrics
- `<Handover01>` - Generate handover document for session continuity
- `<Session-Metrics>` - View detailed session statistics
- `MODE: [DEBUG|BUILD|REVIEW|LEARN|RAPID]` - Switch response mode
- `SCOPE: [MICRO|SMALL|MEDIUM|LARGE|EPIC]` - Set work complexity

</command_triggers>


<automatic_behaviours>
1. **On Session Start**: Run health check, load previous state if exists
2. **Every 10 Messages**: Background health check with warnings
3. **On Mode Switch**: Update session state and load mode-specific guidelines
4. **On Health Warning**: Suggest natural breakpoints for handover
</automatic_behaviours>

<session_state_management>
Session state is stored in `{{TOOL_DIR}}/session/current-session.yaml` and includes:
- Health status and message count
- Current mode and scope
- Active task (reference ID, phase, progress)
- Context (current file, branch, etc.)
</session_state_management>

<session_state_management_guide>
When health reaches 🟡, proactively:
1. Complete current logical unit of work
2. Update todo list with completed items
3. Prepare handover documentation
4. Save all session state for seamless resume
</session_state_management_guide>

## Core Principles

*Encapsulate Everything*
   - This is the most fundamental and essential principle, always follow this where you can
   - Encapsulate at each layer of abstraction e.g. Deep Classes with shallow interfaces with self explanatory naming and function naming, and at module level with many internal classes providing a simple module interface, again well named

0.⁠ ⁠*Always run multiple Task invocations in a SINGLE message when sensible* - Maximize parallelism for better performance.

1.⁠ ⁠*Aggressively use specialized agents* - Custom agent definitions in ⁠ {{HOME_TOOL_DIR}}/agents/ ⁠ (available in this repo under `agents/`):
   - ⁠ distinguished-engineer ⁠ - Drive system design and high‑leverage tradeoffs

   - ⁠ /brainstorm ⁠ - Generate ideas and alternatives
   - ⁠ /critique ⁠ - Provide critical review of approach or code
   - ⁠ /expose ⁠ - Expose assumptions, risks, unknowns
   - ⁠ /do-issues ⁠ - Execute a queue of issues
   - ⁠ /crypto-research ⠀ - Comprehensive crypto market research and analysis

3.⁠ ⁠*Testing Philosophy*:
   - Favour high-level and behavioural tests over unit tests
   - Verify flows and outcomes, not internal wiring
   - Focus on integration and acceptance tests

4.⁠ ⁠*Type Design in Typed Languages*:
   - Prefer domain-specific types over primitives
   - Use ⁠ IP ⁠ instead of ⁠ string ⁠, ⁠ TemperatureC ⁠ instead of ⁠ int ⁠
   - Encode invariants at compile time for correctness with minimal tests

5.⁠ ⁠*Commit Hygiene*:
   - **ALWAYS commit via the `/commit` skill, NEVER raw `git commit` ad-hoc.** The skill runs the pre-commit cleanup (env files, debug scripts, stray docs, skill-output scratch under `.agents/{goals,plans,research,scratch,handover}/`), enforces atomic single-concern staging by named paths (never `git add -A` / `git add .`), and applies the rules below in a checklist. Running `git commit` directly skips all of that and is how skill scratch ends up in PRs.
   - Never mention Claude, AI, or assistance in commit messages
   - Write commits as if authored by a human developer
   - Follow conventional commit format without attribution
   - Default to many small single-concern commits; never bulk-commit. If already bulked, rebase into smaller commits before pushing (`git reset --soft HEAD~N` + rebuild, or `git rebase -i` to split)
   - Apply the atomic rule to docs/README work too: one commit per *visual/structural concern* (hero image, section rename, bullet rewrite, showcase, callout — not a single "docs: update README"). Before writing the commit message, count the distinct intents; if there's more than one, split.
   - Before recommending a merge, run `/review` proactively on the PR — don't wait to be asked
   - If CI fails: diagnose root cause first. If failures are pre-existing drift unrelated to the PR's code (provable via git history + clean local tests), offer merge options honestly rather than forcing a massive cleanup commit



# Tool Usage Strategy

<tool_selection_hierarchy>
1. **MCP Tools First**: Check if there are MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools available that can serve the purpose
2. **CLI Fallback**: If no MCP tool exists, use equivalent CLI option
   - Fetch latest man/help page or run with --help to understand usage
   - Examples: Use `psql` instead of postgres tool, `git` instead of git tool, `gh` instead of github tool 
3. **API Direct**: For web services without CLI, use curl to call APIs directly
   - Examples: Use Jira API, GitHub API, etc.

<code_search_requirements>
CRITICAL: For ALL code searches, use ast-grep via Bash tool instead of the built-in Grep tool.

**ast-grep is REQUIRED for:**
- Finding function/method definitions
- Finding class/struct definitions
- Finding imports/exports
- Finding call sites
- Any structural code query

**Command patterns by language:**
```bash
# Rust
ast-grep --lang rust -p 'fn $NAME($$$) { $$$ }'
ast-grep --lang rust -p 'struct $NAME { $$$ }'
ast-grep --lang rust -p 'impl $TYPE { $$$ }'

# Go
ast-grep --lang go -p 'func $NAME($$$) $RET { $$$ }'
ast-grep --lang go -p 'func ($R $TYPE) $NAME($$$) $RET { $$$ }'
ast-grep --lang go -p 'type $NAME struct { $$$ }'

# TypeScript/JavaScript
ast-grep --lang ts -p 'function $NAME($$$) { $$$ }'
ast-grep --lang ts -p 'const $NAME = ($$$) => { $$$ }'
ast-grep --lang tsx -p '<$COMPONENT $$$>$$$</$COMPONENT>'

# Python
ast-grep --lang python -p 'def $NAME($$$):'
ast-grep --lang python -p 'class $NAME($$$):'
```

**Supported Languages:**
- System: C, Cpp, Rust
- Backend: Go, Java, Python, C-sharp
- Frontend: JS, JSX, TS, TSX, HTML, CSS
- Mobile: Kotlin, Swift
- Config: Json, YAML
- Other: Lua, Thrift

**Only use ripgrep (rg) or built-in Grep tool for:**
- Plain text searches (comments, strings, log messages)
- Non-code files (markdown, config, documentation)
- When ast-grep doesn't support the language
- Simple literal string matching

**Other CLI tools:**
- Find Files: `fd`
- Select among matches: pipe to `fzf`
- JSON: `jq`
- YAML/XML: `yq`

**If a CLI tool is not available, install it and use it.**

# graphify
- **graphify** (`{{HOME_TOOL_DIR}}/skills/graphify/SKILL.md`) - any input to knowledge graph. Trigger: `/graphify`
When the user types `/graphify`, invoke the Skill tool with `skill: "graphify"` before doing anything else.
