"""Claude Code adapter for the reflect-kb plugin (v4 §Phase 2 adapter work).

This is a thin wrapper that plugs reflect-kb into the Claude Code `.claude`
layout on a user's machine. It:

  1. Writes pointer skill files into ``~/.claude/skills/<skill_name>/`` so
     Claude's skill discovery picks them up. The pointer references the
     canonical SKILL.md under the reflect-kb plugin, rather than copying the
     whole tree — updates to the upstream skill propagate automatically.
  2. Merges a SessionStart hook snippet into ``~/.claude/settings.json`` so
     the recall skill fires on session start.

Both steps support ``--dry-run`` (report intent, no filesystem changes) and
are idempotent. The Claude harness is the only one with hook parity; Codex
and Copilot get pointer-only installs (see their respective adapters).

Usage::

    python claude_adapter.py install --dry-run
    python claude_adapter.py install
    python claude_adapter.py install --force        # overwrite hand-written siblings
    python claude_adapter.py install --no-hooks     # skip settings.json merge
    python claude_adapter.py uninstall

Most of the install/uninstall mechanics live on :class:`AdapterBase`. The
Claude-specific pieces are the SessionStart hook injection and the bespoke
pointer body that doesn't mention "no hooks" (since Claude *does* have them).
